<h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</h3>
  <h4>Developer: CD PROJEKT RED</h4>
<h4>Release Date: December 10 2020</h4>
<h4>Steam Deck Rating: Verified (one of the top played games on Steam Deck)</h4>
<p>
 Cyberpunk 2077’s gameplay is a wild mix of hacking, melee combat, and gunfights, pieces that don't seemingly fit together, but in the dark future of Cyberpunk 2077, these things are everyday commonplace.
  My favorite (and current) in-game build is a netrunner, a mercenary that takes out opponents via hacking and disrupting their cyberware. In terms of weaponry, I lean more towards 
  Monowire (a thin laser wire that can cut through enemies) and Katana. But I always keep a shotgun in my inventory just in case I'm unable to hack or attack enemies 
  

In Night City, Exploration is just as important as combat. Night City is extremely expansive, with side gigs, random encounters, and hidden lore tucked into alleys and apartments. 
  (Which isn't even including the entire new area that gets unlocked with the DLC, Phantom Liberty). From what I've seen, it's obvious that CD Projekt Red built upon what they learned with The Witcher 3's open world
  Not just that, the game is visually stunning (one of the most visually impressive games I currently own), which is one of the reasons I run the game at 45 FPS, mainly to conserve as much battery as possible, 
 as the game lasts for about two hours unplugged. Despite the constraints, the game is exceptionally fun, and its lore is impeccable (and sometimes, it hits a little bit too close to the real world these days)

Thats not even going into the Money and upgrades. Between gigs, selling loot, and upgrading cyberware, there's no time to rest in the City of Dreams 
  Especially when you only have a month left ;)
